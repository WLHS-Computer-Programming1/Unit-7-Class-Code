I pronounce tuple too-pull on Mon/Wed/Fri and tub-pull on Tue/Thu/Sat. 
On Sunday I don't talk about them. :)

In the file linear_calculations.py, complete the slope and distance
function. Each function takes in two tuples, representing two (x,y) points,
and returns the slope or distance as a float.
